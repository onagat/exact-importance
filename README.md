# exact-importance

Programs to exactly calculate the importance of sets of nodes for three aspects of importance in SIR network epidemiology: influence maximization, vaccination and sentinel surveillance. For more (but not much more . . . sorry, drop me an email after giving it some time . . . I want to see how useful this seems before starting to write lengthy comments . . the code could need some simplification and clean-up too) info, check the files. infmax, vacc and senti (in Python and (sometimes 10000 times faster) C) computes importance (as functions of beta) for influence maximization, vaccination and sentinel surveillance respectively. eval_res.py evaluates the output. This code accompanies the paper "Three faces of node importance in network epidemiology: Exact results for small graphs".
